				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>
					When analyzing congressional financial disclosures, one useful lens is the industry sector in which trades occur. This approach helps illuminate where lawmakers are concentrating their investments and whether those investments correlate with their committee assignments, policy agendas, or insider access. By breaking down trades by sector, we gain a more comprehensive understanding of how congressional portfolios reflect broader economic trends—and potentially personal advantage.
				</p>

				<h2>Top Traded Sectors</h2>
				<p>
					Based on aggregated data from public filings, the sectors most commonly traded by lawmakers include:
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Technology:</strong> Includes companies in software, semiconductors, cloud infrastructure, and AI. High growth and innovation keep this sector a favorite.</li>
						<li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> Encompassing pharmaceuticals, biotech, and insurance providers. Often tied to legislative discussions around pricing and access.</li>
						<li><strong>Finance:</strong> Banks, investment firms, and fintech companies often draw trades, especially around regulatory cycles.</li>
						<li><strong>Energy:</strong> Oil, gas, and renewable energy companies are popular among lawmakers on environmental or commerce committees.</li>
						<li><strong>Defense:</strong> Government contractors benefit from national security spending, making them attractive targets.</li>
					</ul>
					These sectors often coincide with major legislative and regulatory events.
				</p>

				<h2>Correlation with Committee Assignments</h2>
				<p>
					A significant number of trades appear to correlate with lawmakers’ committee responsibilities. For instance, members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee tend to invest heavily in energy and health sectors. Similarly, those on financial oversight committees often trade in bank and fintech stocks.
				</p>
				<p>
					While this may reflect genuine interest or knowledge in an industry, it also raises ethical questions about access to non-public information and influence over relevant legislation.
				</p>

				<h2>Changes Over Time</h2>
				<p>
					The popularity of sectors has shifted over the years. During the COVID-19 pandemic, lawmakers traded heavily in biotech and healthcare firms. In the years since, there has been a surge in technology and defense-related trades, especially as tensions rose around cybersecurity and international conflicts.
				</p>
				<p>
					Economic cycles, policy agendas, and emerging technologies all influence which sectors dominate in disclosures.
				</p>

				<h2>Notable Spikes and Clusters</h2>
				<p>
					Volume spikes in a single sector—such as multiple trades in clean energy companies right before green energy legislation—can signal coordinated or opportunistic behavior. Analysts look for clusters of similar trades across multiple lawmakers to identify trends worth investigating.
				</p>

				<h2>Sector Diversification and Risk</h2>
					<p>
					Some lawmakers maintain diversified portfolios across multiple sectors, possibly to hedge risk or reduce scrutiny. Others exhibit concentrated positions in one or two areas. Sector-specific concentration can imply either confidence or insider familiarity.
				</p>
				<p>
					These patterns help inform oversight efforts and flag potential conflicts for further examination.
				</p>

				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				<p>
					A sectoral breakdown of congressional trades reveals much about the priorities, interests, and potential ethical hazards among lawmakers. By tracking which industries see the most trades—and when those trades occur relative to legislative activity—we gain sharper insights into the overlap between policymaking and personal finance. Continued transparency and public analysis are essential to ensure accountability.
