				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>
					Transparency in public service is a cornerstone of democratic accountability, and financial disclosures are a key part of that transparency. But what exactly are lawmakers required to disclose? While the rules may seem comprehensive at first glance, there are important nuances and limitations that affect what the public can actually see. This article explores the types of financial information that members of Congress must report, how the process works, and what gaps remain.
				</p>

				<h2>Annual Financial Disclosures</h2>
				<p>
					Each year, members of Congress are required to file an Annual Financial Disclosure Report. This report provides a snapshot of a lawmaker’s financial situation, including their assets, income, liabilities, and certain affiliations. These reports must be filed by May 15 for the previous calendar year and are made publicly accessible.
				</p>
				<p>
					Key elements that must be disclosed include:
					<ul>
						<li>Assets such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and real estate</li>
						<li>Unearned income (e.g., capital gains, dividends)</li>
						<li>Earned income outside of their congressional salary</li>
						<li>Liabilities such as loans and mortgages over $10,000</li>
						<li>Positions held in businesses or organizations</li>
						<li>Agreements involving compensation or future employment</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<h2>Periodic Transaction Reports (PTRs)</h2>
				<p>
					Beyond the annual report, lawmakers must also file a Periodic Transaction Report (PTR) for individual financial transactions over $1,000. These must be filed within 30 to 45 days of the transaction and are intended to flag any suspicious trading behavior that could suggest insider knowledge or conflicts of interest.
				</p>
				<p>
					PTRs include details such as the date of the trade, asset type, transaction category (buy/sell), and a dollar range estimate of the transaction’s value.
				</p>

				<h2>What’s Not Required</h2>
				<p>
					Despite the breadth of required disclosures, there are notable omissions that reduce the system’s transparency. Lawmakers do not have to:
					<ul>
						<li>Disclose the exact value of assets or income—only ranges</li>
						<li>Reveal the identities of clients if they’re attorneys or consultants</li>
						<li>Disclose most assets held by adult children</li>
						<li>Provide exact addresses for real estate holdings</li>
						<li>File real-time updates on stock trades unless they surpass $1,000</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<h2>Enforcement and Penalties</h2>
				<p>
					Failure to comply with disclosure rules can result in fines—typically $200 per violation—and potential referral to the House or Senate Ethics Committee. However, enforcement has been sporadic, and many violations go unpunished or receive waivers.
				</p>
				<p>
					This lack of accountability has prompted criticism from transparency advocates and the public, who argue that the current system lacks the teeth needed to deter abuse.
				</p>

				<h2>The Role of Public Access</h2>
				<p>
					Disclosures are accessible online, but the formats vary in usability. Some are easily searchable databases, while others are PDFs requiring manual review. This inconsistency makes it more difficult for journalists and watchdog groups to identify patterns of concern.
				</p>
				<p>
					Third-party aggregators like Capitol Trades and OpenSecrets have stepped in to streamline this data, improving accessibility and encouraging broader civic engagement.
				</p>

				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				<p>
					While lawmakers are required to disclose a range of financial information, the system is far from perfect. The use of value ranges, limited enforcement, and certain exemptions mean that the public still lacks a complete picture. Greater transparency would require reforms in both disclosure requirements and the technologies used to access them. Until then, the disclosures remain a valuable—but incomplete—tool for ensuring that elected officials remain accountable to the people they serve.
