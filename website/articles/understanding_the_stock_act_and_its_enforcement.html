				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>
					Passed in 2012, the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act was a landmark piece of legislation designed to curb insider trading among public officials and restore public trust in government. The law aims to ensure that lawmakers do not use nonpublic information for personal financial gain. But more than a decade later, questions remain about how well the STOCK Act is enforced and whether it truly deters unethical behavior.
				</p>

				<h2>Key Provisions of the STOCK Act</h2>
				<p>
					The STOCK Act introduced several important rules:
					<ul>
						<li>Requires members of Congress, top staffers, and other public officials to disclose stock trades of $1,000 or more within 45 days</li>
						<li>Clarifies that public officials are subject to insider trading laws</li>
						<li>Makes financial disclosures more accessible to the public through online databases</li>
						<li>Extends similar disclosure requirements to executive branch employees and federal judges</li>
					</ul>
					The lawâ€™s passage was hailed as a bipartisan effort to increase accountability.
				</p>

				<h2>Enforcement Challenges</h2>
				<p>
					Despite its good intentions, the STOCK Act suffers from inconsistent enforcement. While the law technically allows for civil penalties of up to $200 per late filing, many violations go unpunished or receive only nominal fines. There is no central authority that proactively monitors disclosures for accuracy or timeliness.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ethics committees in the House and Senate are responsible for enforcement, but critics argue that these bodies are not truly independent and may be reluctant to sanction their colleagues. This creates an environment where late filings are common, and public confidence in the system wanes.
				</p>

				<h2>Notable Violations and Trends</h2>
				<p>
					Over the past decade, numerous lawmakers have filed late or incomplete disclosures. Some have made significant trades around the time of key legislative actions, raising questions of impropriety. However, few have faced meaningful consequences.
				</p>
				<p>
					Watchdog organizations and media outlets have stepped in to fill the enforcement gap, creating public pressure that sometimes leads to greater transparency. Still, without structural reform, reliance on third parties remains an inadequate substitute for robust oversight.
				</p>

				<h2>Calls for Reform</h2>
				<p>
					There are growing calls to strengthen the STOCK Act. Proposals include:
					<ul>
						<li>Increasing penalties for noncompliance</li>
						<li>Requiring pre-approval or blind trust mechanisms for trades</li>
						<li>Creating an independent ethics watchdog with investigative power</li>
						<li>Enhancing real-time public access to filings</li>
					</ul>
					These reforms aim to ensure that disclosure laws are not merely symbolic but have tangible consequences.
				</p>

				<h2>Public Awareness and Accountability</h2>
				<p>
					Public interest in congressional trading has surged in recent years, driven by high-profile cases and improved access to disclosure data. This awareness has led to more scrutiny from journalists, data analysts, and ordinary citizens.
				</p>
				<p>
					Websites and tools that track congressional trades have amplified calls for accountability, highlighting patterns of behavior that merit further investigation. As awareness grows, so does the demand for stronger enforcement.
				</p>

				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				<p>
					The STOCK Act was a necessary step toward transparency in government, but its effectiveness is limited by weak enforcement and structural loopholes. To ensure public officials are held to the highest standards, reforms must go beyond disclosure to include meaningful oversight and consequences. Only then can the law fulfill its promise of restoring trust in the integrity of public service.
