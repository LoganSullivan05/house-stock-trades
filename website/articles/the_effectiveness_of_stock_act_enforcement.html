				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>
					When the STOCK Act was passed in 2012, it marked a significant milestone in holding members of Congress and federal officials accountable for their financial dealings. The legislation requires timely disclosure of stock transactions, reinforcing the idea that lawmakers should not profit from nonpublic information. However, a decade later, many question the STOCK Act’s effectiveness in achieving its goals. This article evaluates how well the law is enforced, where it falls short, and what reforms could strengthen its impact.
				</p>

				<h2>The Intent Behind the STOCK Act</h2>
				<p>
					The STOCK Act was designed to address the perceived lack of transparency and accountability in Congress. It mandates that members of Congress, senior staff, and executive branch officials disclose trades over $1,000 within 45 days. The goal was to deter insider trading and ensure the public could track potential conflicts of interest.
				</p>
				<p>
					Additionally, the law clarified that public officials are not exempt from insider trading laws, a point that had previously been ambiguous. In theory, the law brought Washington more in line with the standards expected of private-sector employees and corporate insiders.
				</p>

				<h2>Compliance and Loopholes</h2>
				<p>
					While the STOCK Act has led to thousands of trade disclosures, compliance is uneven. Many members file late or omit key details. The penalty for a late filing is a $200 fine—a fee so minor that some lawmakers reportedly treat it as a cost of doing business.
				</p>
				<p>
					Moreover, there is no central enforcement body to proactively ensure compliance. Ethics committees may respond to violations after the fact, but they often lack resources and face political pressure. As a result, accountability tends to rely more on media scrutiny and public outcry than on institutional oversight.
				</p>

				<h2>Limited Enforcement Mechanisms</h2>
				<p>
					One major weakness in the STOCK Act’s enforcement is the lack of investigative authority. Ethics committees typically only act when a complaint is filed or when a lawmaker self-reports a violation. There are no audits or routine checks of trades to identify suspicious activity.
				</p>
				<p>
					Additionally, the law does not bar members of Congress from owning or trading individual stocks. This creates ongoing conflicts of interest, even when disclosures are technically compliant. The gap between legal adherence and ethical behavior remains wide.
				</p>

				<h2>High-Profile Examples</h2>
				<p>
					Several lawmakers have come under fire for trades that appeared to benefit from inside knowledge. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed weaknesses in enforcement when multiple senators sold stock following private briefings on the virus’s expected impact. While these cases drew public attention, few resulted in penalties or prosecution.
				</p>
				<p>
					These incidents reinforce the perception that powerful officials operate under a different set of rules. The failure to apply meaningful consequences contributes to public cynicism and undermines trust in the integrity of government institutions.
				</p>

				<h2>Public Perception and Political Will</h2>
				<p>
					Despite its noble aims, the STOCK Act is widely viewed as symbolic rather than substantive. Surveys show that a large majority of Americans support stricter rules on congressional stock trading. Yet political will for major reforms remains elusive, partly because such rules would limit the financial flexibility of lawmakers themselves.
				</p>
				<p>
					Transparency advocates argue that disclosure is not enough. True accountability requires robust enforcement mechanisms, higher penalties, and greater limitations on what lawmakers can invest in while in office.
				</p>

				<h2>Potential Reforms</h2>
				<p>
					To improve enforcement, some have proposed creating an independent oversight agency with authority to audit disclosures and investigate trades. Others support banning members of Congress from trading individual stocks altogether or requiring them to place assets in blind trusts.
				</p>
				<p>
					Reform legislation has been introduced in Congress, but most proposals have stalled. Until structural changes are implemented, enforcement of the STOCK Act will likely remain limited, relying heavily on media coverage and public outrage to drive accountability.
				</p>

				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				<p>
					The STOCK Act was a step toward greater transparency, but its enforcement has proven weak and inconsistent. While the law has succeeded in raising awareness and generating data, it falls short as a tool for meaningful oversight. Without tougher penalties, better investigative powers, and a shift in political culture, the STOCK Act risks becoming more of a public relations tool than a pillar of good governance.
