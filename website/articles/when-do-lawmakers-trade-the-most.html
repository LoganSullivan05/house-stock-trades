				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>
					Understanding when lawmakers trade can be as revealing as what they trade. Patterns in timing often align with legislative sessions, market events, or even classified briefings. By analyzing the timing of trades, citizens and watchdog groups can identify potential conflicts of interest or opportunistic behavior. This article breaks down the common timeframes when congressional trading activity tends to spike.
				</p>

				<h2>Pre-Session and Post-Session Spikes</h2>
				<p>
					Trades tend to cluster just before or after legislative sessions. Lawmakers may adjust their portfolios in anticipation of policy shifts, or after having gained insights during committee hearings or strategy meetings. Pre-session trading is particularly scrutinized when it precedes major economic policy debates or regulatory rollouts.
				</p>

				<h2>Before Major Hearings and Votes</h2>
				<p>
					Trading activity has been observed to spike shortly before key committee hearings or floor votes, particularly when industries involved may be affected. For example, trades in defense contractors may increase ahead of defense spending votes, or pharmaceutical trades may rise ahead of FDA policy changes.
				</p>
				<p>
					This raises concerns over lawmakers using non-public information, even if it isn’t classified.
				</p>

				<h2>End-of-Quarter Behavior</h2>
				<p>
					Similar to institutional investors, some lawmakers show a pattern of making trades near the end of financial quarters. This may relate to portfolio rebalancing, tax considerations, or preparation for financial disclosures. Such activity is often timed just ahead of earnings season or economic data releases.
				</p>

				<h2>During Market Turbulence</h2>
				<p>
					Periods of economic uncertainty, such as during the COVID-19 outbreak or financial crises, often see increased trading by lawmakers. Some members of Congress have faced scrutiny for selling stocks right before market crashes—suggesting foreknowledge of disruptions via privileged briefings.
				</p>
				<p>
					While not always illegal, these trades raise ethical red flags and prompt calls for stricter regulations.
				</p>

				<h2>Filing Deadline Effects</h2>
				<p>
					The STOCK Act requires members of Congress to report trades within 45 days. As deadlines approach, many lawmakers file batches of trades at once—sometimes dating back weeks. This behavior can obscure real-time transparency and make it harder for watchdogs to react promptly.
				</p>
				<p>
					Late filings or frequent use of the full 45-day window can also signal attempts to delay disclosure.
				</p>

				<h2>Weekday Preferences</h2>
				<p>
					Most trades are reported during weekdays, especially Tuesday through Thursday. Mondays and Fridays see fewer transactions, aligning with general market behavior. This suggests that lawmakers, or their advisors, follow typical trading patterns when executing orders.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, anomalous activity during off-hours or weekends—if reported—can sometimes point to algorithmic or pre-scheduled transactions.
				</p>

				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				<p>
					The timing of congressional trades offers valuable clues about intent, access to information, and market strategy. While not all timing patterns indicate wrongdoing, repeated spikes around sensitive periods merit closer scrutiny. By watching when lawmakers trade—not just what—they trade—concerned citizens and analysts can better detect potential conflicts and advocate for reform.
