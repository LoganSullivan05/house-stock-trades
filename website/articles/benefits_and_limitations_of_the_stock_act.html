				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>
					The STOCK Act—formally known as the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act of 2012—was introduced as a legislative response to growing concerns about insider trading by lawmakers. Its passage was meant to restore public trust and increase transparency in the financial dealings of government officials. While it has achieved some of its goals, the STOCK Act is not without flaws. This article examines its key benefits and limitations.
				</p>

				<h2>What the STOCK Act Requires</h2>
				<p>
					The STOCK Act mandates that members of Congress, senior executive branch officials, and other federal employees disclose stock transactions valued at over $1,000 within 45 days. These reports must include the asset name, transaction date, and an estimated value range. The law also makes these disclosures publicly accessible.
				</p>
				<p>
					It also reaffirms that insider trading laws apply to members of Congress—previously a gray area due to a lack of precedent.
				</p>

				<h2>Key Benefits of the Act</h2>
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Financial disclosures are now published online, making it easier for the public and media to track potential conflicts of interest.</li>
						<li><strong>Accountability:</strong> The requirement for timely reporting adds urgency to compliance and creates a paper trail that can be audited.</li>
						<li><strong>Deterrence:</strong> By highlighting the legal risk of insider trading, the law serves as a behavioral deterrent.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<h2>Limitations and Loopholes</h2>
				<p>
					Despite these benefits, the STOCK Act has several notable shortcomings:
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Enforcement is weak:</strong> Violations often result in small fines or no penalties at all, even when reporting is egregiously delayed.</li>
						<li><strong>Delayed disclosures:</strong> The 45-day window allows trades to go unreported for weeks, diminishing the value of real-time accountability.</li>
						<li><strong>Ambiguity in value ranges:</strong> Lawmakers report trades using wide value bands (e.g., $15,001–$50,000), making it hard to assess the exact scale.</li>
						<li><strong>Minimal coverage:</strong> Some financial instruments, such as options and foreign assets, may not be disclosed with the same rigor.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<h2>Calls for Reform</h2>
				<p>
					In light of these limitations, several advocacy groups and lawmakers have proposed amendments to the STOCK Act. Common suggestions include:
					<ul>
						<li>Reducing the disclosure window to 24 hours</li>
						<li>Requiring blind trusts for all elected officials</li>
						<li>Strengthening enforcement through third-party audits and larger penalties</li>
					</ul>
					While these proposals face political headwinds, they reflect growing frustration with the status quo.
				</p>

				<h2>Public Perception and Trust</h2>
				<p>
					The mere existence of the STOCK Act has helped raise public awareness about congressional trading. However, recurring headlines about late or suspicious filings erode trust in the system.
				</p>
				<p>
					For the Act to fulfill its promise, improvements in both transparency and enforcement are necessary.
				</p>

				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				<p>
					The STOCK Act was a landmark step toward greater ethical accountability in Congress, but it is far from perfect. While it provides useful transparency and affirms legal boundaries, it lacks the enforcement teeth needed to ensure full compliance. As debate continues around financial ethics in government, reforming the STOCK Act remains a key lever for building public trust.
