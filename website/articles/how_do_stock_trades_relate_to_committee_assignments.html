				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>
					In Congress, committee assignments play a central role in shaping legislation and regulatory policy. Members often gain early access to industry insights, policy drafts, and strategic information based on the committees they serve on. But does this insider vantage point influence how lawmakers invest in the stock market? This article explores the relationship between stock trades and committee assignments, with a focus on possible patterns, conflicts of interest, and transparency implications.
				</p>

				<h2>The Power of Committees</h2>
				<p>
					Congressional committees oversee specific sectors of the economy. For example:
					<ul>
						<li>The Energy and Commerce Committee handles telecommunications and healthcare.</li>
						<li>The Armed Services Committee oversees defense and national security.</li>
						<li>The Financial Services Committee monitors banking and markets.</li>
					</ul>
					These roles grant members access to classified briefings, closed-door hearings, and draft regulations—giving them deep visibility into industry trends before the public.
				</p>

				<h2>Patterns in Trading Activity</h2>
				<p>
					Analyses of public disclosure data have uncovered patterns linking trades to committee assignments. Lawmakers on the Energy and Commerce Committee, for instance, have made frequent trades in healthcare and biotech stocks. Those on Financial Services often invest in banks, fintech, or mortgage firms. This clustering raises questions about whether trades are coincidental or informed by non-public knowledge.
				</p>

				<h2>Case Studies and Concerns</h2>
				<p>
					In several high-profile instances, lawmakers traded stocks shortly before or after committee-related events:
					<ul>
						<li>A member of the Senate Intelligence Committee sold shares in travel and hospitality companies after classified COVID-19 briefings.</li>
						<li>Members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee invested in companies working on pandemic treatments and vaccines just before public announcements.</li>
					</ul>
					These cases have sparked ethics complaints and public backlash—even if they were not technically illegal.
				</p>

				<h2>Insider Risk and Regulation</h2>
				<p>
					The STOCK Act was passed to address these risks, requiring timely disclosure of trades. However, it does not prohibit trading based on non-public legislative knowledge unless it rises to the level of material insider information. This leaves a gray area where questionable—but legal—behavior persists.
				</p>
				<p>
					Critics argue that lawmakers should be held to higher standards due to their privileged positions. Calls for blind trusts and trading bans have grown louder, particularly for members with powerful committee roles.
				</p>

				<h2>Calls for Reform</h2>
				<p>
					To mitigate potential conflicts of interest, several reforms have been proposed:
					<ul>
						<li>Ban individual stock trading for members of Congress.</li>
						<li>Require blind trusts to separate investments from influence.</li>
						<li>Enhance oversight of trades made by committee members.</li>
					</ul>
					Support for these reforms spans party lines, reflecting growing concern over ethical governance.
				</p>

				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				<p>
					Committee assignments grant lawmakers deep insight into industries, and trade data often reflects that alignment. While current laws require disclosure, they fall short of preventing the appearance—or reality—of conflicted investing. For transparency and trust in government to improve, a clearer separation between legislative duties and personal financial interests may be necessary.
