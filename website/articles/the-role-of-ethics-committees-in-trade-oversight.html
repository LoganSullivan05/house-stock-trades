				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>
					As public scrutiny over financial transparency intensifies, ethics committees have emerged as a central mechanism for monitoring and enforcing standards among elected officials. In Congress, these committees play a pivotal role in overseeing compliance with the STOCK Act, ensuring members disclose their trades on time, and investigating potential conflicts of interest. However, the structure, effectiveness, and perceived impartiality of these bodies have sparked ongoing debate. This article explores how ethics committees function, their successes and limitations, and what reforms could strengthen their oversight.
				</p>

				<h2>Structure and Mandate of Congressional Ethics Committees</h2>
				<p>
					The House and Senate each have their own ethics committees—bipartisan panels tasked with interpreting and enforcing chamber-specific ethics rules. In the House, the Committee on Ethics (formerly known as the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct) is responsible for reviewing disclosures, investigating misconduct, and issuing sanctions. The Senate Select Committee on Ethics serves a similar function.
				</p>
				<p>
					These committees can initiate investigations based on complaints, media reports, or referrals from other bodies. They are empowered to issue letters of admonition, fines, or even recommend expulsion in extreme cases. Despite this authority, the committees are composed of sitting members of Congress, which raises questions about impartiality and accountability.
				</p>

				<h2>The STOCK Act and Reporting Enforcement</h2>
				<p>
					The STOCK Act, passed in 2012, mandates that members of Congress disclose financial trades exceeding $1,000 within 45 days. Ethics committees are charged with enforcing this requirement, often issuing reminders or minor fines for late filings. However, critics argue that penalties are too lenient and inconsistent.
				</p>
				<p>
					For example, some lawmakers have reported trades months late without facing meaningful consequences. In many cases, the fine for a late report is just $200—barely a deterrent for individuals with significant personal wealth. This has led watchdog groups to question whether ethics committees prioritize institutional protection over meaningful enforcement.
				</p>

				<h2>Challenges to Effective Oversight</h2>
				<p>
					Ethics committees face several structural and political challenges. Because they consist of peers judging peers, there is an inherent risk of bias, especially in high-profile or politically sensitive cases. Committees are often reluctant to investigate or punish fellow members unless public pressure is overwhelming.
				</p>
				<p>
					Additionally, the scope of these committees is limited. They do not audit trades for insider information nor conduct deep forensic investigations. Instead, they primarily focus on procedural compliance—ensuring that disclosures are filed, not necessarily that trades are ethical.
				</p>

				<h2>Transparency and Public Perception</h2>
				<p>
					Public trust in ethics committees has waned in part because of perceived inaction. When violations occur without real consequences, constituents grow skeptical of the integrity of congressional oversight. The existence of ethics rules alone is not enough; the public must see them enforced.
				</p>
				<p>
					Transparency around committee proceedings is also limited. Investigations are often confidential, and decisions may be issued without detailed explanations. This lack of openness can obscure accountability and fuel narratives of elitism and insider protection.
				</p>

				<h2>Reform Proposals</h2>
				<p>
					To strengthen the role of ethics committees, reform advocates propose several changes. One idea is to introduce independent ethics offices with investigative power, similar to the now-defunct Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE), which had nonpartisan staff and operated separately from Congress.
				</p>
				<p>
					Another recommendation is to increase the severity of penalties for late or misleading disclosures and to mandate public reporting of investigations and outcomes. Improved digital tracking systems and regular auditing of trades could also help ensure timely compliance and spot patterns of suspicious activity.
				</p>

				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				<p>
					Ethics committees play an essential but often underwhelming role in overseeing congressional trades. While they serve as the first line of accountability, their effectiveness is hindered by structural limitations, minimal enforcement, and perceived conflicts of interest. To restore public confidence and reinforce ethical standards, reforms that promote independence, transparency, and stronger penalties are crucial. Only then can ethics oversight evolve from symbolic formality to substantive deterrent.
