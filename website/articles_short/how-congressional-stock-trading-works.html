		<h1>How Congressional Stock Trading Works</h1>
	</header>

	<article>
		<section>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>Congressional stock trading refers to the buying and selling of publicly traded securities by members of the United States Congress. While members of Congress are not banned from trading stocks, they are subject to specific disclosure and ethics rules designed to prevent conflicts of interest and promote transparency.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Legal Framework</h2>
			<p>The STOCK Act (Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act), passed in 2012, requires all members of Congress to publicly report their stock transactions within 30 to 45 days. The aim is to ensure that lawmakers do not profit from non-public information obtained through their legislative roles.</p>

			<h2>What Must Be Disclosed?</h2>
			<p>Members must file a Periodic Transaction Report (PTR) for any stock trades over $1,000. These disclosures must include the date of the transaction, the asset traded, and the estimated value range of the trade.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Oversight and Enforcement</h2>
			<p>While the House and Senate Ethics Committees oversee these disclosures, enforcement is generally lax. Fines for late filings are minimal, often only $200 per violation, and repeated offenses rarely result in severe consequences.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Why It Matters</h2>
			<p>The intersection of lawmaking and personal financial gain raises concerns about conflicts of interest. Critics argue that members of Congress could be influenced by their personal investments when drafting legislation, especially when it involves sectors in which they are financially involved.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>Understanding how congressional stock trading works is key to holding elected officials accountable. While laws like the STOCK Act exist to promote transparency, ongoing scrutiny and reform efforts continue to shape the conversation around political investing.</p>
