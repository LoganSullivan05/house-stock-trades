			<h2>Performance</h2>
			<p>Studies have shown that congressional trades sometimes outperform market indexes, especially when timed around key legislative events. Wall Street, meanwhile, relies on advanced analytics and algorithmic trading for consistent performance.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Motivations and Oversight</h2>
