			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>Congressional stock disclosures provide a unique opportunity to examine whether elected officials tend to take aggressive investment risks or lean toward safer, more conservative portfolios. This article explores the trading strategies reflected in their financial activity.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Defining Aggressive vs. Conservative</h2>
			<p>In investing, an aggressive strategy involves frequent trading, higher-risk assets, and timing plays. Conservative investing typically means long-term holdings, blue-chip stocks, and minimal portfolio changes.</p>

		<section>
			<h2>Trade Volume and Frequency</h2>
			<p>Some members of Congress report dozens or even hundreds of trades annually, often in volatile sectors. Others report infrequent or no trades, suggesting a more hands-off, conservative approach.</p>

		<section>
			<h2>Sector Selection</h2>
			<p>Frequent investment in speculative sectors like biotech, crypto, or startups could indicate higher risk tolerance. Conversely, repeated investment in index funds or established companies points toward conservative strategy.</p>

		<section>
			<h2>Behavioral Patterns</h2>
			<p>Data shows that lawmakers with committee assignments relevant to finance or tech often display more nuanced trading patterns, but not always more conservative ones. Their access to industry insights can influence investment confidence.</p>

		<section>
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>Congressional trading strategies vary widely. While many favor conservative investments for stability and optics, others show signs of active portfolio management and risk-taking. Transparency remains essential to monitor these trends fairly.</p>
