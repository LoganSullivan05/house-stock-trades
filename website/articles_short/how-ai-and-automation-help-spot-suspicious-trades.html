			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>As congressional trading data becomes more accessible, technology is playing a growing role in identifying suspicious activity. This article explores how AI and automation are used to analyze lawmaker transactions for patterns that may signal ethical or legal issues.</p>
		</section>

			<h2>Automated Data Collection</h2>
			<p>Disclosure scraping tools continuously monitor government websites for new filings. These tools convert raw PDFs into structured datasets, which can be analyzed more efficiently than manual review allows.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Machine Learning Models</h2>
			<p>AI models can be trained on historical trade data to identify outliersâ€”trades that deviate significantly from the norm in timing, size, or stock selection. These anomalies may indicate foreknowledge of market-moving events.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Natural Language Processing</h2>
			<p>NLP techniques are used to correlate news articles, bill texts, and press releases with disclosed trades. By matching keywords and dates, AI can assess whether trades appear to be timed around relevant political developments.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Alerts and Dashboards</h2>
			<p>Some platforms generate real-time alerts or visual dashboards when new trades are flagged as unusual. These tools are increasingly used by journalists, watchdogs, and even retail investors to stay informed.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Challenges and Limitations</h2>
			<p>AI analysis is only as good as the data available. Inconsistent reporting formats, vague asset descriptions, and limited enforcement can obscure true intent. Human judgment remains essential for interpreting flagged trades.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>AI and automation have transformed how congressional trades are monitored, helping to bring transparency and accountability to political finance. As technology evolves, these tools will become even more powerful in uncovering questionable behavior.</p>
