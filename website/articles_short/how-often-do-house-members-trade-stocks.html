			<h2>Introduction</h2>

			<h2>Frequent Traders</h2>
			<p>There are a handful of representatives who appear to treat investing almost as a side business, trading on a near-monthly or weekly basis. These individuals often face heightened scrutiny and are sometimes accused of leveraging insider information.</p>

			<h2>Low-Activity Members</h2>
			<p>On the other hand, many members report no trades at all in a given year. Some avoid trading altogether to sidestep any perception of conflict of interest, or because they hold assets in blind trusts or index funds.</p>

			<h2>What the Data Reveals</h2>
			<p>Patterns in trade frequency often align with committee assignments, personal wealth, and market conditions. For example, during volatile periods, congressional trading activity typically increases.</p>

			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>Understanding how often House members trade stocks offers insight into their investment strategies and priorities. While frequent trading doesn’t necessarily imply wrongdoing, it warrants transparency and public vigilance.</p>
