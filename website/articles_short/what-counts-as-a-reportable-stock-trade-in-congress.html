		<h1>What Counts as a Reportable Stock Trade in Congress?</h1>
	</header>

	<article>
		<section>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>Not every financial move made by a member of Congress needs to be disclosed. The STOCK Act sets clear thresholds and criteria for what constitutes a reportable stock trade. This article outlines what trades must be reported and why.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Minimum Thresholds</h2>
			<p>Only trades with a value exceeding $1,000 are considered reportable. This applies to purchases, sales, or exchanges of stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and other securities. Smaller transactions fall below the reporting threshold and are not disclosed.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Types of Reportable Assets</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Individual stocks and equities</li>
				<li>Bonds and fixed-income securities</li>
				<li>Mutual funds and ETFs</li>
				<li>Options, derivatives, and other complex instruments</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

			<h2>Whatâ€™s Not Reported?</h2>
			<p>Assets held in certain retirement accounts, such as TSPs or employer-sponsored 401(k)s, are generally not subject to transaction reporting. Additionally, jointly held assets managed by third-party advisors may fall outside the scope if the member lacks direct control.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Reporting Deadlines</h2>
			<p>Once a reportable trade occurs, a Periodic Transaction Report (PTR) must be filed within 30 to 45 days. These filings include the transaction date, asset type, and a value range but not the exact dollar amount.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>Understanding what qualifies as a reportable trade helps voters assess the transparency and behavior of their elected officials. While the STOCK Act provides a foundation, public engagement is key to accountability.</p>
