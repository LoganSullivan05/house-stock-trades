			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>Financial transparency is a cornerstone of democratic governance. In the context of U.S. politics, it refers to the disclosure of personal financial activity by elected officials, helping to ensure that public service is not compromised by private interests.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Why Transparency Matters</h2>
			<p>Transparency builds trust between government and citizens. When politicians are open about their finances, the public can better evaluate whether decisions are made in the public's interest or for personal gain.</p>

		<section>
			<h2>Congressional Financial Disclosures</h2>
			<p>Members of Congress are required to disclose financial assets, liabilities, income sources, and significant stock trades. These disclosures allow voters, watchdogs, and journalists to identify potential conflicts of interest.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Tools for Accountability</h2>
			<p>Publicly available financial data has fueled tools and platforms that track political trading, increasing oversight and enabling citizen-led investigations. Transparency empowers ordinary people to play a watchdog role.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Limitations and Challenges</h2>
			<p>While the existence of disclosure laws is positive, their effectiveness depends on timely reporting and meaningful enforcement. Many violations go unpunished, and complex disclosures can obscure more than they reveal.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>Financial transparency in politics is not just a legal requirementâ€”it's a democratic imperative. Continued advocacy for stronger enforcement and clearer reporting standards is essential for a healthy political system.</p>
