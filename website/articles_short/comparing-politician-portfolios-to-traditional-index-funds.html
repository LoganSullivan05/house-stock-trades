			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>Index funds offer a passive, diversified approach to investing, favored by many financial advisors for their long-term reliability. But how do these compare to the stock portfolios disclosed by members of Congress? This article examines the key differences and performance implications.</p>

			<h2>What Is an Index Fund?</h2>
			<p>An index fund is a type of mutual fund or ETF designed to replicate the performance of a specific market index, like the S&P 500. These funds are known for low fees, broad diversification, and consistent returns over time.</p>

			<h2>Congressional Portfolio Traits</h2>
			<p>Unlike index funds, congressional portfolios are typically handpicked and reflect individual preferences. These may include concentrated bets in tech, healthcare, or defense stocks and sometimes involve frequent trading.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Performance Comparison</h2>
			<p>Studies show that, on average, index funds perform as well or better than actively managed portfolios—especially after accounting for fees and taxes. Some political portfolios outperform, but many also underperform due to lack of diversification or timing errors.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Risk and Transparency</h2>
			<p>Index funds are transparent and diversified by design. Political portfolios, however, vary widely in their risk exposure, and their motivations are harder to evaluate. Disclosure helps, but public confidence depends on consistent reporting.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>Comparing political portfolios to index funds reveals the value of disciplined, diversified investing. While some lawmakers succeed with active strategies, index funds remain a proven choice for most investors—and a benchmark for evaluating elected officials’ financial decisions.</p>
