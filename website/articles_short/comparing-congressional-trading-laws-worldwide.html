		<h1>Comparing Congressional Trading Laws Worldwide</h1>
	</header>

	<article>
		<section>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>While the U.S. has the STOCK Act to regulate congressional trades, other countries handle lawmaker finance rules differently. This article compares global approaches to transparency, disclosure, and conflict-of-interest laws in politics.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>United States</h2>
			<p>The U.S. requires members of Congress to disclose trades over $1,000 within 45 days under the STOCK Act. Enforcement is handled internally by ethics committees, and fines for violations are minimal.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>United Kingdom</h2>
			<p>In the U.K., Members of Parliament must declare financial interests, including stock holdings, within 28 days. However, they are not required to disclose every transaction, limiting transparency on trade timing.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Canada</h2>
			<p>Canada bans lawmakers from holding stocks in companies directly affected by their duties. Assets are often placed in blind trusts, and disclosures are reviewed by an independent ethics commissioner.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Germany</h2>
			<p>German lawmakers must declare income and asset classes, but detailed trade reporting is not mandatory. Critics argue the rules lack the granularity to identify potential conflicts.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Australia</h2>
			<p>Australian MPs disclose financial interests in public registers, including shareholdings. However, there is no obligation to report specific trades, and enforcement is light.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Comparative Insights</h2>
			<p>Globally, few nations mandate real-time or detailed trade disclosures like the U.S. The most effective systems rely on independent oversight and restrictions on active investing while in office.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>While the U.S. has room for improvement, its disclosure system is more detailed than many peer nations. Still, stronger enforcement and clearer restrictions remain key to setting a global standard for financial ethics in politics.</p>
