			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>Congressional stock disclosures provide a unique lens into the investing habits of U.S. politicians. These patterns reveal how lawmakers approach risk, timing, and asset selection—and may even hint at their expectations for market behavior.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Preferred Assets</h2>
			<p>Lawmakers often favor large-cap tech companies, index funds, and blue-chip stocks. These choices may reflect a strategy focused on stability and long-term growth rather than speculative gains.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Risk Profiles</h2>
			<p>Some members of Congress trade conservatively, rarely buying or selling. Others display more aggressive behavior, entering and exiting positions frequently—sometimes in high-volatility sectors like biotech or crypto.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Timing and Volatility</h2>
			<p>Trading activity often spikes around major legislative or economic events. Some politicians appear to time the market effectively, fueling ongoing debate about access to privileged information and ethical boundaries.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Comparative Analysis</h2>
			<p>When compared with retail investors or institutional funds, political trades may exhibit distinct timing advantages. While not conclusive evidence of misconduct, it suggests that access and insight may play a role in investment outcomes.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>The data shows that congressional investing is far from uniform. Analyzing trends in asset preference, frequency, and timing can help the public better understand the financial behaviors of elected officials—and why transparency remains critical.</p>
