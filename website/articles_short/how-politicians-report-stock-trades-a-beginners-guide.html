	<article>
		<section>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>For those new to the topic, understanding how politicians report stock trades can be confusing. This guide provides a clear overview of the reporting process, important rules, and how the public can view these financial activities.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>The Basics of Trade Reporting</h2>
			<p>Under the STOCK Act, members of Congress must file a Periodic Transaction Report (PTR) when they buy or sell a stock, bond, or other security worth over $1,000. The filing must occur within 30 to 45 days of the transaction date.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>What's in a PTR?</h2>
			<p>PTRs include the following information:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Name of the asset</li>
				<li>Type of transaction (purchase, sale, exchange)</li>
				<li>Date of the transaction</li>
				<li>Estimated value range (e.g., $1,001–$15,000)</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Where to Find These Reports</h2>
			<p>You can view these reports on the <a href="https://disclosures-clerk.house.gov/">U.S. House of Representatives financial disclosure website</a>. Other transparency platforms aggregate and analyze the data to make it more accessible.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Common Pitfalls</h2>
			<p>Some politicians miss deadlines or submit incomplete information. Although the STOCK Act imposes fines for late filings, enforcement is inconsistent, and the data may be delayed or imprecise.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>Learning how stock trades are reported by elected officials empowers voters and researchers to identify potential conflicts of interest. As transparency tools improve, staying informed becomes easier and more impactful.</p>
