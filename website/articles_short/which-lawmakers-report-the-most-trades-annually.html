		<h1>Which Lawmakers Report the Most Trades Annually?</h1>
	</header>

	<article>
		<section>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>Some members of Congress are far more active in the stock market than others. This article highlights lawmakers who report the highest volume of trades each year and explores what that level of activity might mean.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>High-Frequency Filers</h2>
			<p>Lawmakers such as Rep. Dan Crenshaw and Rep. Ro Khanna have, in some years, reported hundreds of trades. While legal, this high volume invites scrutiny over whether trading is a side hobby—or something more strategic.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Reasons for High Trade Counts</h2>
			<p>High activity may be the result of managed portfolios, family involvement, or deliberate investment strategies. Still, these lawmakers are held responsible for reporting accurately, regardless of who makes the trades.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Transparency and Patterns</h2>
			<p>More trades mean more disclosures—providing a clearer picture of where interests lie. Analysts use this data to spot trends, such as sector preferences, trade timing, or potential alignment with legislative activity.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Criticism and Concerns</h2>
			<p>Critics argue that excessive trading by lawmakers distracts from public service and raises conflict-of-interest concerns. When frequent trades align with committee assignments or legislation, public trust is at stake.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>High-frequency trading among lawmakers is not inherently illegal—but it does raise questions. As transparency grows, so do calls for stricter rules to ensure that public office is not used for private financial gain.</p>
