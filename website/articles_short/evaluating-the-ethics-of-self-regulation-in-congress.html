		<h1>Evaluating the Ethics of Self-Regulation in Congress</h1>
	</header>

	<article>
		<section>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>Members of Congress are responsible for writing the laws that govern themselves, including those related to financial disclosure and stock trading. This article examines the ethical concerns and limitations of self-regulation in a democratic institution.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Understanding Self-Regulation</h2>
			<p>Currently, Congress polices its own members through internal ethics committees and legislation like the STOCK Act. While these mechanisms exist to enforce transparency and accountability, their effectiveness is often questioned.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Conflicts of Interest</h2>
			<p>Critics argue that lawmakers have little incentive to impose strict rules on themselves. When the same individuals who benefit from weak regulation are tasked with crafting it, the result can be a lack of meaningful oversight.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Case Studies and Enforcement Gaps</h2>
			<p>There have been numerous cases of delayed or inaccurate financial disclosures with minimal consequences. The perception that lawmakers face different standards than the public undermines trust in government integrity.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Reform Proposals</h2>
			<p>Advocates for reform call for independent ethics oversight, real-time trade disclosures, and even full bans on individual stock ownership. These proposals aim to eliminate conflicts of interest and rebuild public confidence.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>Self-regulation poses serious ethical questions in any governing body, especially when financial interests are involved. Stronger oversight—potentially from external bodies—may be necessary to ensure fairness and accountability in Congress.</p>
