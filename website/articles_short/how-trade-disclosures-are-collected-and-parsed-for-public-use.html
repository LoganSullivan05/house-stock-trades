			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>Congressional stock trade disclosures are legally required, but the process of collecting and making that data usable involves multiple technical and manual steps. This article outlines how disclosure data is gathered, structured, and published.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Source of Disclosures</h2>
			<p>Members of Congress submit financial transaction reports (PTRs) to the Clerk of the House or the Secretary of the Senate. These reports are made available online, usually in PDF format, as part of the STOCK Act compliance process.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Scraping and Conversion</h2>
			<p>Since disclosures are not provided in machine-readable formats, data analysts and civic tech projects use PDF scraping tools and OCR software to extract transaction data. This is a labor-intensive process, often requiring human verification.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Structuring the Data</h2>
			<p>Once extracted, the data is cleaned and standardized. Fields such as lawmaker name, transaction type, ticker symbol, and date are formatted consistently to allow for analysis and visualization.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Public Tools and Repositories</h2>
			<p>Platforms like Quiver Quantitative, Capitol Trades, and public GitHub repositories aggregate this structured data and make it accessible via APIs or dashboards. These tools empower researchers, journalists, and citizens to explore congressional trading behavior.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Challenges in Accuracy</h2>
			<p>Parsing errors, inconsistent report formats, and vague descriptions pose challenges. Efforts to improve data accuracy rely on community validation and feedback loops.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>Transforming congressional disclosures into usable data requires a mix of technology, manual labor, and transparency advocacy. Continued innovation in data parsing ensures the public can hold elected officials accountable through better access to financial activity.</p>
