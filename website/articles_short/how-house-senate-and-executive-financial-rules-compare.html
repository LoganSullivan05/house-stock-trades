		<h1>How House, Senate, and Executive Financial Rules Compare</h1>
	</header>

	<article>
		<section>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>Financial transparency and ethics rules vary across the three branches of U.S. government. Understanding the similarities and differences between the House, Senate, and Executive Branch helps clarify how each is held accountable for financial conduct.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>House of Representatives</h2>
			<p>Members of the House must file annual financial disclosures and periodic transaction reports under the STOCK Act. Oversight is provided by the House Ethics Committee, but enforcement is often limited and penalties for violations are minor.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Senate</h2>
			<p>Senators follow similar rules as House members, including disclosure of assets, liabilities, and trades. The Senate Select Committee on Ethics oversees compliance, and like the House, it has been criticized for weak enforcement and lack of transparency.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Executive Branch</h2>
			<p>Senior officials in the Executive Branch must also file financial disclosures and avoid conflicts of interest. However, they are often subject to additional requirements, such as divestment or blind trusts, especially for presidential appointees and Cabinet members.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Key Differences</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Enforcement:</strong> The Executive Branch may involve the Office of Government Ethics (OGE), providing more consistent oversight than congressional ethics committees.</li>
				<li><strong>Asset Restrictions:</strong> Executive officials are more likely to face mandatory divestment, while lawmakers retain broad investment freedom.</li>
				<li><strong>Public Transparency:</strong> Disclosure formats and accessibility vary, with congressional reports often harder to analyze.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>Each branch of government has its own system for handling financial conflicts, with varying degrees of rigor. Understanding these distinctions is essential for evaluating how well public servants are held accountable in their financial dealings.</p>
