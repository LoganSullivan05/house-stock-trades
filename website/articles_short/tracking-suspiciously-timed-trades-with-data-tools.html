			<h2>Data Collection and Integration</h2>
			<p>Trade disclosures are scraped and parsed from official reports, often in PDF or image formats. These datasets are then merged with stock market data and legislative calendars to establish context around each trade.</p>

			<h2>Flagging Anomalies</h2>
			<p>Algorithms can flag trades that deviate significantly from a lawmakerâ€™s usual activity or coincide with confidential committee meetings, major votes, or public events. These red flags warrant further investigation.</p>

			<h2>Visualization Dashboards</h2>
			<p>Interactive dashboards allow users to filter trades by date, sector, or politician, and to visualize trade clusters around policy announcements. These tools make it easier to spot correlations that aren't obvious in raw data.</p>

			<h2>Use by Journalists and Watchdogs</h2>
			<p>Transparency advocates, journalists, and academics increasingly rely on these data tools to hold lawmakers accountable. Their findings often shape public discourse and push for regulatory reform.</p>
