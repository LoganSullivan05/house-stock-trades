			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>Stock trades made by Congress members often spark controversy when they coincide with key legislation. This article investigates common patterns of trading activity before and after major policy announcements or bill passages.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Legislation-Linked Timing</h2>
			<p>Disclosures have revealed that lawmakers sometimes buy or sell stocks shortly before a vote or announcement that significantly affects the industry involved. While legal if non-public information isn't used, the timing often raises ethical concerns.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Case Studies</h2>
			<p>Examples include trades made before the CARES Act in 2020 or the CHIPS Act in 2022. These transactions involved industries that directly benefited from government funding or policy shifts.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Sector-Specific Trends</h2>
			<p>Healthcare, energy, and tech sectors are frequently traded around the time of legislation. These industries are highly sensitive to regulatory changes, subsidies, or spending bills.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Ethical and Legal Considerations</h2>
			<p>While the STOCK Act prohibits trading on material non-public information, proving intent is difficult. This gray area continues to fuel calls for stronger restrictions on lawmaker stock ownership.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Transparency and Reform</h2>
			<p>Tracking trading timelines in relation to legislation helps the public evaluate the integrity of elected officials. Improved transparency tools and shorter disclosure windows could further reduce suspicion and conflict.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>Patterns of trading before and after legislation often highlight the blurry line between legal investing and perceived insider advantage. Ongoing scrutiny is essential to protect public trust in the legislative process.</p>
