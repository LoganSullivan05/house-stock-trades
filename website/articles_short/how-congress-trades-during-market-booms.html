		<h1>How Congress Trades During Market Booms</h1>

	<article>
		<section>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>While political trading during downturns raises concerns, behavior during bull markets is also worth scrutiny. This article investigates how members of Congress trade when markets are soaring and how their strategies compare to retail and institutional investors.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Growth-Focused Portfolios</h2>
			<p>During market booms, lawmakers tend to increase holdings in growth sectors such as technology, green energy, and consumer discretionary. These trades often align with broader market trends and anticipated policy impacts.</p>

		<section>
			<h2>FOMO and Herding Behavior</h2>
			<p>Just like average investors, some lawmakers appear to follow the herd—buying into hot stocks or sectors after major gains. While this might signal confidence in continued growth, it also raises questions about market timing and reactive investing.</p>

		<section>
			<h2>Increased Trade Volume</h2>
			<p>Market booms often see a surge in trading volume among lawmakers. Whether seeking short-term profits or riding momentum, this uptick suggests a more active approach to portfolio management during favorable conditions.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Legislative Influence on Bull Markets</h2>
			<p>Policies promoting stimulus, deregulation, or sector-specific support can contribute to bull markets. Lawmakers investing in sectors benefiting from their own legislation risk appearing self-serving, even when trades are legal and disclosed.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>Congressional trading activity doesn't stop when markets rise—in fact, it often increases. Understanding how lawmakers behave during economic upswings is crucial for maintaining trust and ensuring accountability, regardless of market conditions.</p>
