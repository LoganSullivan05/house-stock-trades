		<h1>How Corporate Executives and Congress Members Differ in Disclosures</h1>
	</header>

	<article>
		<section>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>Both corporate executives and members of Congress are required to disclose financial activity—but the rules, timing, and enforcement differ significantly. This article explores how these two powerful groups compare in terms of transparency and accountability.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Disclosure Requirements</h2>
			<p>Corporate executives must file Form 4 with the SEC within two business days of insider trades. In contrast, members of Congress have up to 45 days to report trades over $1,000 through Periodic Transaction Reports under the STOCK Act.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Access to Information</h2>
			<p>Executives have internal knowledge of company performance, while lawmakers may access macroeconomic and policy information. Both types of knowledge can influence markets, but only one group is tightly regulated in how they trade on it.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Enforcement and Penalties</h2>
			<p>SEC oversight ensures that corporate violations are often met with fines, bans, or legal action. Congressional violations, however, are typically addressed through small fines and rarely escalate to serious legal consequences.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Transparency Tools</h2>
			<p>SEC filings are digitized and easy to access via EDGAR. Congressional disclosures are often uploaded as PDFs and inconsistently formatted, making them harder to track without third-party tools.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>While both corporate leaders and lawmakers have disclosure obligations, the systems that govern them differ in speed, enforcement, and accessibility. Reform advocates argue that lawmakers should be held to the same—or higher—standards as corporate insiders.</p>
