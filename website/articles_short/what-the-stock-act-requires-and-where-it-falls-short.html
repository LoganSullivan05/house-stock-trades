			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>The STOCK Act was passed in 2012 to address concerns over insider trading and increase transparency in Congress. While it introduced new reporting requirements and ethical standards, many believe it hasn’t gone far enough. This article breaks down the law’s key features and its limitations.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>What the STOCK Act Covers</h2>
			<p>The law requires members of Congress, senior staff, and other federal officials to publicly disclose stock trades over $1,000 within 45 days. It aims to deter insider trading and restore public trust by making financial activity more transparent.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Public Access to Data</h2>
			<p>Initially, the law provided a searchable online database of disclosures. However, parts of this accessibility were later rolled back due to security concerns. Today, access often requires downloading individual PDFs, limiting usability.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Penalties and Enforcement</h2>
			<p>One of the most criticized aspects of the STOCK Act is its weak enforcement. Fines for late disclosures are typically minimal—often just $200—and there is little public record of serious consequences for repeat offenders.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Where It Falls Short</h2>
			<p>Critics argue that the 45-day window is too long and allows trades to remain hidden during critical periods. Additionally, the reliance on self-reporting and lack of oversight reduce the law’s effectiveness.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Proposals for Reform</h2>
			<p>Reform advocates suggest real-time disclosures, higher penalties, and mandatory blind trusts to address the STOCK Act’s shortcomings. These changes aim to create a stronger deterrent and enhance the law’s integrity.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>The STOCK Act was a step in the right direction—but it’s far from perfect. To fully ensure transparency and ethical behavior, Congress may need to strengthen the law with bolder, more enforceable provisions.</p>
