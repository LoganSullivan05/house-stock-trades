		<h1>Congressional Trading vs. Insider Trading: Where’s the Line?</h1>
	</header>

	<article>
		<section>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>While members of Congress are allowed to trade stocks, many question how close some of their trades come to insider trading. This article examines the line between legal congressional trading and illegal insider activity.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>What Is Insider Trading?</h2>
			<p>Insider trading involves buying or selling a security based on material, non-public information. It's illegal in the private sector and strictly enforced by the SEC with fines and criminal penalties.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Congress and Non-Public Information</h2>
			<p>Members of Congress have access to confidential briefings, classified reports, and early policy discussions. While the STOCK Act prohibits them from trading on such information, proving a violation is extremely difficult.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Notable Cases and Controversies</h2>
			<p>Several lawmakers faced scrutiny for trades made before major events like the COVID-19 pandemic or infrastructure legislation. While investigations were launched, few led to formal charges due to lack of direct evidence.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>The Legal Gray Area</h2>
			<p>The burden of proof for insider trading among lawmakers is high. The line between using experience and exploiting privileged information remains murky, and few mechanisms exist to investigate potential abuse thoroughly.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Calls for Reform</h2>
			<p>To prevent conflicts of interest, some advocate banning individual stock ownership for lawmakers or requiring all assets to be placed in blind trusts. These reforms would minimize the appearance—and potential—of impropriety.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>While insider trading laws apply to Congress, enforcement is rare and controversial. Bridging the gap between public service and private financial interest remains an ongoing challenge in American politics.</p>
