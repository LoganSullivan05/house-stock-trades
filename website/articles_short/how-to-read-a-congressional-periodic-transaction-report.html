			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>Periodic Transaction Reports (PTRs) provide a snapshot of financial activity by members of Congress. Learning to read these reports helps voters evaluate potential conflicts of interest and gain insight into the financial behavior of elected officials.</p>

			<h2>What Is a PTR?</h2>
			<p>A PTR is a disclosure form required by the STOCK Act. It must be filed within 30–45 days of a qualifying transaction, such as a stock or bond purchase over $1,000. These reports are accessible to the public and can be found on official government websites.</p>

				<li><strong>Owner:</strong> Indicates whether the asset belongs to the member, spouse, or dependent child.</li>
				<li><strong>Asset Name:</strong> The stock, bond, or fund traded.</li>
