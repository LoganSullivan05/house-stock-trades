	</header>

	<article>
		<section>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>The idea of banning stock trading by members of Congress has gained traction in recent years. Supporters see it as essential for restoring public trust, while opponents argue it’s an overreach. This article explores both sides of the debate.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Arguments in Favor of a Ban</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Preventing Conflicts of Interest:</strong> Lawmakers should not be financially invested in industries they regulate.</li>
				<li><strong>Restoring Public Trust:</strong> A ban would demonstrate a commitment to ethical governance and reduce suspicion.</li>
				<li><strong>Eliminating Temptation:</strong> Prohibiting trading removes the opportunity for abuse or the appearance of impropriety.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Arguments Against a Ban</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Right to Personal Finance:</strong> Critics argue that lawmakers, like all citizens, have the right to manage their own investments.</li>
				<li><strong>Slippery Slope:</strong> Opponents worry that restrictions on financial autonomy could extend to other areas of personal life.</li>
				<li><strong>Transparency Over Prohibition:</strong> Some believe that rigorous disclosure and enforcement are better than an outright ban.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Alternative Solutions</h2>
			<p>Proposals include requiring lawmakers to place holdings in blind trusts or restricting trades only during certain periods. These compromises aim to balance ethical concerns with personal freedoms.</p>

		<section>
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>The debate over a congressional stock trading ban reflects broader tensions between ethics, transparency, and individual rights. As public awareness grows, so does pressure for lawmakers to act decisively—either by banning trading or reinforcing accountability measures.</p>
