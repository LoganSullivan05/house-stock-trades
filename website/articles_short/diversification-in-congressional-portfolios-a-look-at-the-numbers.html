			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>Diversification is a key principle in investing—spreading assets across sectors to reduce risk. But how well do members of Congress follow this strategy? This article explores the level of diversification found in congressional stock portfolios.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>What Is Diversification?</h2>
			<p>Diversification involves owning a variety of assets across different industries and risk levels. This can help protect against losses in any single sector or company.</p>

		<section>
			<h2>Analyzing Portfolio Spread</h2>
			<p>Data shows that while some members hold broad portfolios that include dozens of different stocks and funds, others concentrate heavily in just a few high-profile companies or sectors—especially tech and healthcare.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Sector Imbalance</h2>
			<p>Many portfolios reveal sector biases. Tech, energy, and pharmaceuticals are popular, while sectors like utilities or materials are often underrepresented. This may reflect political interests or perceived market opportunity.</p>

			<h2>Use of Funds and Indexes</h2>
			<p>Some members rely on mutual funds or ETFs for diversification, especially those seeking a passive approach or wanting to avoid direct stock ownership conflicts. These instruments offer built-in diversification but still require disclosure.</p>

			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>Congressional portfolios vary in their level of diversification. While some demonstrate sound investment strategy, others show concentrated risk. Monitoring these trends helps the public understand how financial decision-making aligns with legislative responsibility.</p>
