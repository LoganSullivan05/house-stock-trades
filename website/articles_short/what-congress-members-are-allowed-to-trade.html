		<h1>What Congress Members Are Allowed to Trade</h1>
	</header>

	<article>
		<section>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>Congress members are legally permitted to participate in the stock market, but their trading activity is subject to disclosure requirements and ethical guidelines. This article outlines what financial instruments they can trade—and under what conditions.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Permitted Asset Classes</h2>
			<p>Lawmakers can trade a wide range of financial instruments, including individual stocks, mutual funds, ETFs, bonds, and real estate. There are no legal restrictions on specific sectors or companies.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Disclosure Requirements</h2>
			<p>Under the STOCK Act, members must report trades over $1,000 within 30 to 45 days. These disclosures must include the transaction type, amount range, asset name, and transaction date.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Blind Trusts and Recusals</h2>
			<p>To reduce conflicts of interest, some lawmakers place assets in blind trusts or recuse themselves from votes that could affect their holdings. However, these practices are not required by law.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Controversial Areas</h2>
			<p>Trading in sectors that receive federal funding or regulation—like defense, healthcare, and tech—can raise ethical concerns. While legal, such trades often spark calls for stricter rules or bans.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Proposals for Change</h2>
			<p>Some reformers advocate for outright bans on individual stock ownership by lawmakers, allowing only diversified funds. Others support mandatory blind trusts or real-time disclosure systems to ensure accountability.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>Congress members can legally trade most financial assets, but concerns over ethics and conflicts of interest remain. Stronger rules could help align personal financial activity with the public interest.</p>
