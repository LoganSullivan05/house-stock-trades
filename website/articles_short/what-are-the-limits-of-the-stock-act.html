			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>The STOCK Act was introduced to prevent insider trading by members of Congress and promote transparency. But over a decade later, many question whether the law has the teeth to truly hold lawmakers accountable. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of its limitations.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Minimal Enforcement</h2>
			<p>One of the biggest criticisms of the STOCK Act is the lack of meaningful enforcement. Most violations result in modest fines of $200, and some go unpunished entirely. There are no criminal penalties for non-compliance with reporting rules.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Loopholes and Exemptions</h2>
			<p>Lawmakers can still own and trade stocks in sectors they regulate, as long as they disclose the activity. Assets held in blind trusts or managed accounts are often not scrutinized. Additionally, some spouses' financial activities may not be fully transparent.</p>

			<h2>Delayed Disclosures</h2>
			<p>Although trades must be disclosed within 30 to 45 days, the reports can be difficult to track and interpret. This lag reduces real-time oversight, and strategic trading may still occur before the public is informed.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Complexity of Reports</h2>
			<p>The format of Periodic Transaction Reports can be difficult for average citizens to understand. Data is often released as PDFs and reported in broad dollar ranges, making precise analysis difficult without specialized tools.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>The STOCK Act was a step toward transparency, but it has significant limitations. Without stricter enforcement and clearer reporting standards, the law may fail to prevent the very abuses it was designed to stop.</p>
