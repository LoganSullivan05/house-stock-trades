		<h1>What Makes Congressional Trades Different from Insider Trading?</h1>
	</header>

	<article>
		<section>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>Insider trading is illegal when corporate employees use non-public information to profit from securities. But how does this differ from the trades made by members of Congress, who often have early access to critical policy decisions? This article breaks down the distinctions.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Definition of Insider Trading</h2>
			<p>Insider trading refers to the buying or selling of a security by someone with access to material, non-public information. It is strictly prohibited under U.S. securities law and enforced by the SEC.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Congressional Access to Information</h2>
			<p>Members of Congress frequently receive sensitive briefings, economic forecasts, and legislative drafts ahead of the public. While the STOCK Act makes it illegal to trade on this information, enforcement remains rare and vague.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Disclosure Requirements</h2>
			<p>Unlike corporate insiders, lawmakers must disclose trades within 30â€“45 days. However, the delay between trade and disclosure reduces accountability and allows questionable trades to go unnoticed for weeks.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Legal Loopholes</h2>
			<p>Corporate insiders face strict penalties and surveillance. Congressional violations often result in nominal fines, and ambiguous rules make it difficult to prosecute political insider trading effectively.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>Though both scenarios involve privileged access, congressional trades are governed by weaker enforcement and delayed transparency. Until accountability measures are strengthened, the gap between ethics and enforcement will remain.</p>
