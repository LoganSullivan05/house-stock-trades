			<h2>Reactive vs. Predictive Behavior</h2>
			<p>Some trades clearly follow market events, such as purchases after earnings reports or sales during downturns. However, a notable number of transactions occur just before key market shifts, raising questions about foresight or informational advantages.</p>

			<h2>Timing Analysis</h2>
			<p>Research has shown that some political trades outperform market averages. Whether this is due to skill, timing, or access to privileged information is still debated. Patterns that repeatedly align with upcoming legislation suggest possible predictive trading behavior.</p>

			<h2>High-Impact Examples</h2>
			<p>Case studies of well-timed trades—such as those made before COVID-related lockdowns or tech antitrust hearings—demonstrate instances where lawmakers appeared to anticipate market reactions. These examples fuel speculation about informational advantages.</p>
