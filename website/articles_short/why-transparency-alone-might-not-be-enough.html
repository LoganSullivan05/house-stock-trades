		<h1>Why Transparency Alone Might Not Be Enough</h1>

			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>Transparency in congressional stock trading is an important step toward accountability. But many experts argue that simply disclosing trades is not enough to prevent unethical behavior. This article examines the limitations of transparency and what more might be required.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>The Role of Transparency</h2>
			<p>Transparency laws like the STOCK Act require lawmakers to disclose trades publicly. This allows journalists, watchdog groups, and voters to monitor financial activity and spot potential conflicts of interest.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Delayed Reporting Reduces Impact</h2>
			<p>Trades must be disclosed within 30 to 45 days, which limits the effectiveness of real-time oversight. Lawmakers could still act on non-public information and benefit before disclosures are made.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Weak Enforcement</h2>
			<p>Even when disclosures are late or incomplete, consequences are minimal. Small fines and a lack of publicized penalties reduce the deterrent effect of these transparency measures.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Data Accessibility Challenges</h2>
			<p>Disclosure data is often hard to find, poorly formatted, and inconsistently reported. This makes it difficult for the average citizen to analyze or understand what their representatives are doing financially.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Beyond Transparency: Structural Solutions</h2>
			<p>Reform advocates suggest measures like mandatory blind trusts, trading bans during legislative sessions, or full divestment. These structural changes would go further than disclosure alone in addressing conflicts of interest.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>Transparency is essentialâ€”but not sufficient. Without stronger enforcement, real-time reporting, and structural safeguards, lawmakers can still act in ways that undermine public trust. Further reforms are needed to close the gap between visibility and accountability.</p>
