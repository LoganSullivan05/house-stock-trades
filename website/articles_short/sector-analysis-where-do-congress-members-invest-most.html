	</header>

	<article>
		<section>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>Analyzing where members of Congress invest can reveal much about their financial interests—and potential conflicts. This article examines the most common sectors favored by lawmakers and the implications for policy and public trust.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Top Investment Sectors</h2>
			<p>Data from financial disclosures indicates that technology, healthcare, and finance are among the most commonly held sectors. These industries are frequently affected by federal legislation, raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Technology</h2>
			<p>Tech stocks—especially large-cap companies—are popular among lawmakers. This includes companies involved in social media, e-commerce, and semiconductors. Given Congress’s role in regulating data privacy and antitrust issues, this concentration has drawn scrutiny.</p>

		<section>
			<h2>Healthcare and Pharmaceuticals</h2>
			<p>Many legislators invest in healthcare firms and drug manufacturers, even while debating health policy and drug pricing reforms. This overlap has sparked public concern, particularly during events like the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Finance and Banking</h2>
			<p>Investments in banks and financial institutions are also common. Lawmakers sitting on financial oversight committees often hold positions in firms they help regulate, leading to calls for divestment or stricter ethics rules.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>The concentration of congressional investments in sectors shaped by legislation highlights the ongoing need for stronger guardrails. Transparency is crucial—but may not be enough on its own to address the appearance or reality of conflicting interests.</p>
