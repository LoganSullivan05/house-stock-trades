		<h1>Why Delayed Disclosures Undermine Transparency</h1>
	</header>

	<article>
		<section>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>The STOCK Act mandates disclosure of congressional trades within 45 days. But even this short delay can hinder transparency and accountability. This article explores how delayed reporting undermines the spirit of financial ethics in public office.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>The Disclosure Window</h2>
			<p>Lawmakers are given a 30- to 45-day window to report trades. While this is faster than traditional annual reports, it's still slow by modern transparency standards—especially when market-moving events can occur within hours.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Impact on Public Trust</h2>
			<p>Delayed reporting means the public and media cannot react in real time to potential conflicts of interest. When trades surface weeks after key votes or briefings, accountability is weakened, and suspicion grows.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Case Studies in Delay</h2>
			<p>Several members of Congress have faced backlash for disclosing trades long after making them—some after significant market moves. These delays often draw criticism even if they technically comply with the law.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Calls for Reform</h2>
			<p>Transparency advocates are pushing for real-time or near-immediate disclosures. They argue that modern technology makes faster reporting feasible and necessary to preserve ethical standards.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>Transparency delayed is transparency denied. To rebuild trust and prevent ethical gray zones, Congress must adopt tighter disclosure timelines that reflect the speed of today’s markets and media cycles.</p>
