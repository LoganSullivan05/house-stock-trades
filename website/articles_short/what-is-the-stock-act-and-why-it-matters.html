			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>The Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act is a landmark piece of legislation designed to combat insider trading among public officials. Passed in 2012, the law aims to increase transparency and restore trust in the U.S. government by making congressional financial activity more visible to the public.</p>

			<h2>Origins of the STOCK Act</h2>
			<p>The STOCK Act was introduced following growing concerns that members of Congress could use non-public information gained through their legislative work for personal financial gain. Media investigations and public outcry pressured lawmakers into adopting stricter transparency rules.</p>

			<h2>Limitations and Criticisms</h2>
			<p>Despite its intentions, the STOCK Act has been criticized for weak enforcement. Penalties for late disclosures are minimal, and there are few real consequences for noncompliance. Some provisions were quietly rolled back after the law's passage, further weakening its impact.</p>

			<h2>Why It Still Matters</h2>
			<p>Even with its flaws, the STOCK Act remains a critical tool for ensuring transparency. It provides the public with valuable information and has led to the development of tools and websites that track congressional trading behavior in real time.</p>

			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>The STOCK Act was a step forward in regulating financial activity in Congress. Though improvements are needed, its existence demonstrates a commitment—however limited—to holding public officials accountable.</p>
