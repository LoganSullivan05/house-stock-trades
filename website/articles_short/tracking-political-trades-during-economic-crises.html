		<h1>Tracking Political Trades During Economic Crises</h1>

			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>When economic turmoil hits, market behavior shiftsâ€”and so does political trading activity. This article explores how congressional stock trades change during recessions, financial crashes, and global emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Pre-Crisis Movements</h2>
			<p>One of the most controversial patterns is the sale of stocks before public awareness of a crisis. During the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, several lawmakers offloaded holdings shortly after private briefings, fueling allegations of insider trading.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Sector Rotation</h2>
			<p>Economic downturns often prompt lawmakers to shift investments into resilient sectors like healthcare, consumer staples, and defense. These moves can reflect either strategic foresight or privileged information.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Volume and Volatility</h2>
			<p>Trading volume tends to spike around crises as lawmakers adjust their portfolios to hedge losses or seize opportunities. These trades, while legal if disclosed properly, raise ethical questions when timed with sensitive information.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Public Reaction and Oversight</h2>
			<p>The appearance of profiting during national emergencies can erode public trust. Following the 2020 controversies, bipartisan calls emerged for stricter regulations and a ban on individual stock trading by members of Congress.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>Congressional trading during economic crises remains a flashpoint in the ethics debate. Greater transparency, real-time disclosures, and enforceable trading restrictions may be needed to restore credibility and prevent future scandals.</p>
