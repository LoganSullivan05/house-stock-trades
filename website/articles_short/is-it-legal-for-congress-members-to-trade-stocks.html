		<h1>Is It Legal for Congress Members to Trade Stocks?</h1>

			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>The legality of congressional stock trading is a frequent topic of debate, especially when trades coincide with sensitive legislative developments. This article clarifies what the law currently allows and where the legal boundaries are drawn.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Current Legal Framework</h2>
			<p>Yes, it is legal for members of Congress to trade stocks. However, they must comply with disclosure requirements set forth by the STOCK Act, which mandates timely public reporting of transactions over $1,000.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Prohibitions and Restrictions</h2>
			<p>While trading itself is legal, using non-public information obtained through one’s official position—known as insider trading—is illegal. The STOCK Act reinforced this by confirming that lawmakers are subject to existing insider trading laws.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Disclosure Requirements</h2>
			<p>Lawmakers must file Periodic Transaction Reports within 30–45 days of trades. These reports include the asset name, transaction type, date, and an estimated value range. Failure to file on time can result in fines, though penalties are modest.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Enforcement and Loopholes</h2>
			<p>Enforcement of these rules is often inconsistent. Many late filings receive only a $200 fine, and there is little oversight regarding the timing or motivation behind trades. This has prompted calls for tighter restrictions or outright bans.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>While legal under current law, congressional stock trading continues to raise ethical concerns. As scrutiny increases, so do efforts to reform the rules and ensure that lawmakers prioritize public service over personal gain.</p>
