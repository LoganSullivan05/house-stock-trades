		<h1>Who Enforces the STOCK Act and How?</h1>
	</header>

	<article>
		<section>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>The STOCK Act was designed to bring transparency and accountability to congressional stock trading. But who ensures compliance, and what happens when violations occur? This article explores the enforcement landscape of the STOCK Act.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Oversight Bodies</h2>
			<p>The primary enforcement responsibility falls to the House and Senate Ethics Committees. These internal bodies review disclosures, investigate violations, and issue penalties for noncomplianceâ€”usually in the form of small fines.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Role of the Office of Congressional Ethics</h2>
			<p>The Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE) conducts preliminary reviews of potential violations and refers matters to the House Ethics Committee. However, it lacks subpoena power and cannot issue punishments itself.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Public Access and Watchdog Groups</h2>
			<p>Because enforcement by Congress is limited, independent watchdogs, journalists, and citizens often serve as de facto monitors. These groups uncover discrepancies and pressure lawmakers to comply with ethical standards.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Limitations and Criticism</h2>
			<p>Enforcement is often criticized as lax and inconsistent. Fines for late disclosures are minimal, and many violations go unpunished or receive little attention. The perception of self-policing erodes public trust.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Proposals for Better Enforcement</h2>
			<p>Suggested reforms include increasing fines, granting independent bodies enforcement powers, and mandating real-time trade reporting. These changes aim to create a more robust system of accountability.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>While the STOCK Act set important ethical standards, its enforcement remains weak. Strengthening oversight mechanisms is essential to ensure that transparency laws have the power to hold public officials accountable.</p>
