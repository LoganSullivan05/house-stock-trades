			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>Index funds like the S&P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq-100 (QQQ) provide a benchmark for average market returns. But how do trades by members of Congress compare to these passive strategies? This article explores whether lawmakers outperform—or trail behind—the market.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Why Compare to Indexes?</h2>
			<p>Index funds are widely considered a standard for evaluating portfolio performance. Comparing lawmaker trades to these benchmarks helps assess whether political access translates into superior returns.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Performance Analysis</h2>
			<p>Some congressional trades—especially those timed around key events—appear to outperform indexes in short windows. However, over longer periods, many lawmakers perform similarly or worse than passive funds, especially after accounting for market volatility.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Example Scenarios</h2>
			<p>Several lawmakers reported significant gains during COVID-era volatility, with trades in sectors like tech and healthcare beating market averages. Yet, consistent outperformance across years is rare, raising questions about skill versus luck—or access.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Implications for Oversight</h2>
			<p>If lawmakers routinely beat the market, it suggests they may be leveraging informational advantages. If they underperform, it challenges the notion that political power alone leads to successful investing. Either way, transparency is key.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>Comparing congressional trades to index fund returns offers valuable insights into the fairness and effectiveness of current oversight. Whether underperforming or outperforming, these patterns reinforce the need for vigilant disclosure and ethics standards.</p>
